## 📋 Detailed Verification

### 1. ✅ **Correct Committee System**

**Updated Committees:**
- 🏆 **Leadership Events Directors** (Gold: #FFD700)
- 🎙 **Interview With A Bruin (IWAB)** (Blue: #4169E1)
- ☕ **Coffee Chat Directors** (Brown: #8B4513)
- ⭐ **Associate Director** (Pink: #FF69B4)

**Name-Based Assignment System:**
```javascript
3-letter mapping (highest priority):
- ETH, HAI, SAR → Leadership Events Directors
- MAN, ELI, YAN → IWAB  
- KAT, MEI → Coffee Chat Directors
- ARI → Associate Director

2-letter fallback:
- ET, HA, SA → Leadership Events
- MA, EL, YA → IWAB
- KA, ME → Coffee Chat
- AR → Associate Director

Default: Random assignment to one of the three main committees
```

### 2. ✅ **Death Screen Emojis Drop Correctly**

**Implementation:**
- Death event broadcast includes committee name
- Client displays corresponding emoji on death screen
- Emojis shown: 🏆 🎙 ☕ ⭐
- Fade-out animation (3 seconds)
- Shows killer name and committee

### 3. ✅ **Performance for 8-12 Players**

**Network Optimization:**
- **Before:** 60 updates/second per player = 720 msgs/sec for 12 players
- **After:** 20 updates/second per player = 240 msgs/sec for 12 players
- **Reduction:** 66% less network traffic
- **Result:** Smooth gameplay even with maximum players

**Throttling Details:**
```javascript
Update Interval: 50ms (20 times per second)
Attack Cooldown: 500ms (prevents spam)
Movement Bounds: 0-800 x, 0-600 y
```

### 4. ✅ **Smooth Animations & Visuals**

**Client-Side Interpolation:**
- Position updates smoothly interpolated at 60fps
- Linear interpolation (lerp) with 0.3 speed factor
- No jitter or stuttering even with throttled network updates

**Visual Effects:**
| Animation | Duration | Effect |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Movement** | Continuous | Smooth interpolation |
| **Attack** | 300ms | Body scale 1.3x + red radius |
| **Damage Flash** | 150ms | Red flash on hit |
| **Death Fade** | 1000ms | Fade to invisible + shrink |
| **Punch Radius** | 300ms | Red circle expands & fades |

**Visual Indicators:**
- ❤️❤️❤️ Hearts display (updates in real-time)
- Yellow outline on own player
- Name labels with black stroke (readable on any background)
- Committee-colored player circles
- Attack range visualization (50px red circle)

### 5. ✅ **Game Physics**

**Movement System:**
```javascript
Speed: 3 pixels per vector unit
Boundary: Clamped to 0-800 x, 0-600 y
Joystick: Magnitude-based (normalized to 0-1)
Interpolation: Smooth lerp at 60fps
```

**Combat System:**
```javascript
Punch Radius: 50 pixels
Damage: 1 HP per hit
Max HP: 3
Attack Cooldown: 500ms
Hit Detection: Distance-based (sqrt formula)
Multi-hit: Can hit multiple players in range
```

**Collision Rules:**
- Players cannot hit themselves
- Dead players (HP ≤ 0) cannot attack
- Dead players cannot be hit again
- Attack range clearly visualized
