git branch -M main

git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

```

---

## Step 3: Get Your Game URL

Once deployed:
1. You'll see your URL at the top: `https://committee-arena.onrender.com`
2. Click it to open your game!
3. **Share this URL** with anyone - they can all play!

---

## üéÆ Sharing Your Game

**Your Game URL**: `https://YOUR-APP-NAME.onrender.com`

Share this link:
- ‚úÖ Friends can open on phone
- ‚úÖ Friends can open on computer
- ‚úÖ Works anywhere in the world

---

## üîß Updating Your Game

After making changes:

git add -A
git commit -m "Update game"
git push origin main
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### First Load is Slow
- Free tier "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First visitor after sleep = 30-60 second load time
- After that = instant!

### Upgrade to Always-On
- $7/month for 24/7 availability
- No sleep time
- Faster performance

### Check Logs
- If something breaks, click "Logs" in Render dashboard
- Shows server errors

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect"
- Check Render logs for errors
- Make sure deploy succeeded
- Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

### "Can't find repository"
- Make sure you pushed to GitHub (`git push origin main`)
- Refresh Render's repository list

### Game works locally but not online
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify WebSocket connection in Network tab
