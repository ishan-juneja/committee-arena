# 🚀 GitHub Setup Guide

## Quick Setup: Push to GitHub

Follow these steps to push your Committee Arena game to GitHub:

### Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Website (Easiest)

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository:
   - Visit: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `committee-arena`
   - Description: `⚔️ Real-time 2D multiplayer arena game with Colyseus + Phaser 3`
   - Set to **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. **Push your code** (run these commands in your terminal):
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/ishanjuneja/Desktop/Committee Launch Game"
   
   # Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/committee-arena.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Done!** Your repository is now on GitHub! 🎉

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (If installed)

```bash
cd "/Users/ishanjuneja/Desktop/Committee Launch Game"

# Create repository and push in one command
gh repo create committee-arena --public --source=. --push
```

### Verify Your Push

After pushing, visit your repository:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/committee-arena
```

You should see all your files including:
- ✅ README.md with game documentation
- ✅ Server code (TypeScript)
- ✅ Client code (JavaScript/Phaser)
- ✅ Full commit history

### Future Updates

Whenever you make changes, commit and push them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```
